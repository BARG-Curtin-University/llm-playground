# LLM Lab

This repository is a curated collection of notebooks for learning about and experimenting with various aspects of Large Language Models (LLMs). Each folder contains notebooks focused on a specific aspect of LLMs, including chunking, embeddings, evaluation, fine-tuning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and more.

## Notebooks

### Chunking
Notebooks related to text chunking methods and applications within LLMs.

### Embeddings
Notebooks exploring different types of embeddings for natural language processing in the context of LLMs.

### Evaluation
Notebooks focused on evaluating LLMs and their techniques.

### Fine-Tuning
Notebooks on fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs for specific tasks.

### LLM (Large Language Models)
Notebooks centered around large language models, their applications, and experiments.

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
Notebooks demonstrating the integration of retrieval mechanisms with generative models within LLMs.

### Prompt Engineering
Notebooks dedicated to crafting and optimizing prompts for LLMs.

### Small Models
Notebooks on building very small models from scratch, exploring the fundamentals of model architecture and training.

### Data Generation
Notebooks for generating input datasets necessary for training and fine-tuning models.

### Experiments
Notebooks for experimental, temporary, work-in-progress, and proof-of-concept work. This folder includes early-stage ideas and prototypes that are not yet finalized.

## Resources

### Articles
Curated list of articles relevant to LLMs and their applications.
